Unfortunately, I encountered a bug while pushing some files to the repository. Despite my efforts, I was unable to fix it, possibly due to importing some files from Unity assets. As a result, I decided to create a new project and start from scratch by copying my previous work without using any imported files from the Unity asset store. During this week, I added some new features such as a menu with options to play, quit, and link to external resources. Additionally, I added a text prompt that appears when the player is close enough to the ball, reminding them to press 'f' to pick it up. Tomorrow, I plan to begin working on the portals.

Total hours: 8.5
