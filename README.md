Unfortunately, I encountered a bug while pushing some files to the repository. Despite my efforts, I was unable to fix it, possibly due to importing some files from Unity assets. As a result, I decided to create a new project and start from scratch by copying my previous work without using any imported files from the Unity asset store. During this week, I added some new features such as a menu with options to play, quit, and link to external resources. Additionally, I added a text prompt that appears when the player is close enough to the ball, reminding them to press 'f' to pick it up. Tomorrow, I plan to begin working on the portals.

Total hours: 8.5

## Week 6:
1. Create more rooms.
2. Create a practice room with three targets that the player must hit with balls to progress to room 2.
3. Add two different types of balls, each with unique properties.
4. Create very easy quizzes to allow the player to progress from one room to another.
5. Add a restart and win menu, where the player wins the game by killing all the enemies, and the win menu appears.
6. Implement a health system where the player's health decreases if they get hit by a ball
